This repository contains **Array** problems implemented in **Java**.

Some information in the problems can be found duplicated with respect to other problems but that redundant information is useful while revisiting.

# Notes on Array Data Structure
**The Time Complexity of different operations in an array is:**

| Array Operation                 | Assumed Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Access i-th element             | O(1)                    | O(1)             |
| Override element at i-th index  | O(1)                    | O(1)             |
| Traverse all elements           | O(n)                    | O(1)             |
| Insert element                  | O(n)                    | O(1)             |
| Delete element                  | O(n)                    | O(1)             |

-- O(1) complexity means Constant Time
-- O(n) complexity in the above table, refers `n` as the length of the array.
